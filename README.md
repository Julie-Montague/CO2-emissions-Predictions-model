# CO2-emissions-Predictions-model
# OVERVIEW
This is a supervised machine learning project that uses the kaggle canada carbon emissions dataset to compare several models. The goal is to compare different machine learning models to achieve the lowest error rate during predition.
# DATASET
The dataset is can be obtained fro Kaggle and contains variables of different vehicle in canada which are used to predict the quantity of carbon emissions produced
